Geant4 Code of my Undergraduate Thesis at the Physics Department, University of Athens.


**Abstract**

In this thesis, a new experimental setup to measure magnetic moments in exotic
species is studied and simulated. The setup is proposed for development at
GSI/FAIR (Darmstadt, Germany). The experimental setup will use a few stateof-
the-art segmented DEGAS detectors available at GSI, acquire a few large
dipole magnet to induce external magnetic fields required for the application of
the TDPAD (Time-Differential Perturbed Angular Distribution) technique. The
simulations have been carried out using the latest Geant4 simulation package.
The efficiency of the experimental setup is calculated, as well as its dependency
on parameters, such as the detectorâ€“source distance or the number of detectors
used. The simulations aim to offer insight on the detector setup performance in
the initial design phase, especially its absolute effiency.
