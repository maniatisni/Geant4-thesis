Geant4 Simulations regarding the FAIR/gSPEC detector/magnet setup in Germany.

Master branch includes the simple hexagon detector.

Features to be commited are:

1)Array of 4 identical detectors places at a 45Â° angle. (Distance depends on the other features)

2)Magnets

3)A box target of the desired material

4)Eight Poles supporting the magnets

5)Gaussian distribution of gun

6)Casing of detector(s).(??)
